His arrival at the palace caused a minor commotion as mourners and the media rushed to take pictures. On the issue of the Ingonyama Trust, Malema said the matter should still be debated but in an orderly manner. Tuesday was one of the busiest days since the king’s death, as the palace received Deputy President David Mabuza, ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule and former KZN premier Willies Mchunu. Speaking to the media before walking into the palace, Mabuza said King Zwelithini, who died on Friday aged 72, was a straight talker.

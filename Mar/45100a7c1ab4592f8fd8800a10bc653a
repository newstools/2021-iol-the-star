By Editorial Late last year five suspects, four women aged between 27 and 42, and a 32-year-old-man, were arrested in Pretoria for the murder of King Goodwill Zwelithini’s son, Prince Lethukuthula Zulu, 50, who was killed in Joburg. In the king’s palace, a war is brewing over who will be next in line to the throne. Some in the monarchy believed the murder could be related to rivalry among the royals. The slain prince was first in line to South Africa’s biggest throne. The police said the prince was killed while his friend was sleeping in another room. Close family member Badala Zulu told Independent Media that the family was trying to avoid internal wars. With his father, King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu’s death, the succession battles are mounting. With that said, it is interesting to observe reactions to the king’s death. Colonisation has torn us apart – our culture, language, and how we view ourselves. We hate ourselves and all that is about us, while we cheer what is foreign. People in KwaZulu-Natal have a strong feeling that this is a moment for Zulu people. This is true, but what if it was the death of the British Queen Elizabeth? South Africa would broadcasting back-to-back preparations for her funeral. There would be little negativity from the British, and no one would dare refer to her as “Elizabeth”, as they do with the Zulu king, calling him by his birth name. Many people stood up and shouted that the Ingonyama Trust needs to be dissolved “because monarchy in our time is no longer relevant”. But, what about the British monarchy? Is Queen Elizabeth the only person worthy of royalty? It is hard to imagine that the prince could have been murdered to limit the competition to succession. The king and the prince are gone now. Perhaps as the British do, all of us must mourn. The Star

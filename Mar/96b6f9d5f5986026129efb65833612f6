By John Whitlock A recent editorial argues that renaming towns is about “regaining of status” and “dignity”, but does not specify exactly how this comes about with name-changing. I’m sure if a survey was taken among the many thousands of extremely poor people living in the sprawling squatter camps surrounding Gqeberha, they would have found the inhabitants opting for better housing, better sanitation, running water, proper electricity, better streets and street lighting, more jobs and so on, rather than a name change. Were they consulted and given an alternative? Dignity and status comes from a good quality of life – the social or professional position of somebody in relation to others, and being given honour and respect by other people. This is not possible in an informal settlement where people live in abject poverty and horrific social circumstances. Does name-changing put food on the table? Financially South Africa is in dire straits. It was not apartheid or colonialism, as stated in the editorial, that deprived most South Africans of a better life. It was the massive, extensive and never-ending looting of state coffers, incompetent administration of funds, irregular spending and theft. Now is definitely not a good time for wasting money just to boost some politician’s ego, or as retribution for the past. Trying to obliterate history is not the answer. The pronunciation of Gqeberha has nothing to do with it. Just as Johannesburg is colloquially known as “Jozi”, so Gqeberha will probably become known as “Gebers” or “Gebbies Bay”. The intense suffering by millions will continue, irrespective of changing the names of towns. The Star

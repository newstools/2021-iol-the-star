By Geoff Hughes The incomparable Voltaire observed: “The Holy Roman Empire was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire”. If he were still alive, he would perhaps comment that “the British royal family is neither royal, nor British, nor a family”. The current state of play in the media frenzy over the fallout of the Oprah interview with Meghan and Harry is immeasurable, since so many personal, painful and emotive issues have been raised. But there is an essential divide between American freedom and British restraint, going back a century, to the scandalous romance between Edward VIII and the twice-married Mrs Simpson. The British press maintained a resolute silence, whereas the American sensationalised every development of the abdication crisis, to the point that the distributors of Time magazine even scissored out all potentially-libellous references to the affair. Princess Diana rightly saw that the way to get back at “the Firm” was by frank interviews: “There were three people in the marriage.” As “Megxit” becomes “Megxile”, Harry and Meghan are using the same strategy, raising unmentionable, taboo topics such as racism (or “colourism”) and mental health. Meanwhile back at the Palace, belated royal edicts attempt to limit or shut down the conversation … Geoff Hughes is an Emerius professor formerly with Wits. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of The Star or IOL.

A group of pharmacists have joined the legal bandwagon seeking to get blanket approval for the use of ivermectin, currently only registered in SA for veterinary and agricultural use, for the prevention and treatment of Covid-19. The application by the eight pharmacists, who operate under the Pharma Valu chain of pharmacies, will be heard along with three others instituted by AfriForum, the ACDP and a group of 55 doctors callings themselves the “I can make a difference doctors and medical practitioners group” at the end of March. “The legal representatives made submissions to the judge regarding the urgency and public importance of the matters. They have been allocated three court days for hearing, beginning on March 29,” said attorney Kuben Moodley, who represents the doctors. Meanwhile, a Japanese woman in her sixties died from a brain haemorrhage three days after receiving a Pfizer coronavirus vaccination, the health ministry said on Tuesday, adding that there may not be a link between the two. The woman was vaccinated on Friday and is suspected to have suffered a brain haemorrhage three days later. It was Japan's first reported death after a vaccination. IOL

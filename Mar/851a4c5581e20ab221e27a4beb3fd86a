Earlier today the World Health Organization revealed that the Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund has seen unprecedented solidarity. The Fund was created a year ago. WHO DG, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said to date, more than 661 000 donors have contributed nearly US$ 250 million. He said the funds have be used to provide millions of frontline workers with critical personal protective equipment, medical supplies, and testing kits; to  manage misinformation and the infodemic; support vulnerable populations like refugees and displaced persons; and helped accelerate the research on vaccines, tests and treatments. "Despite this progress, current trends show that the fight is far from over. Thatâ€™s why today the fund launches a renewed call for action for funds to contribute to the estimated US$ 1.96 billion required by WHO in 2021 to respond to remaining and new challenges in the fight against Covid," he said.

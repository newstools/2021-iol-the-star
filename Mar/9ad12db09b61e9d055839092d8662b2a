"Our cumulative recoveries today stand at 1 459 056 representing a recovery rate of 95%.The number of health care workers vaccinated under the Sisonke Protocol stands at 168 413," he said. Meanwhile, there have been concerns raised about the country's vaccine roll out program. IOL reported that SA has an ambitious target of vaccination two-thirds of the population before the end of the year. At the current rate, at an average of about 6000 vaccinations per day, it would take the country 18 years, one month and three days to achieve herd immunity. The Department of Health has previously clarified that the slow rate of the vaccination rollout was due to the fact that the first phase of the rollout was being carried out as part of a study, which has strict protocols that need to be adhered to.

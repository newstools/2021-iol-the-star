By John Whitlock I have, over the years, become very concerned about the superior logic of most of our politicians. The logic, or lack thereof, has just been confirmed by the vague comments made by Free State ANC secretary, Paseka Nompondo. He firmly believes the “government should step up the renaming process” (streets and places) because “it could improve service delivery”. He also stated municipalities – most of them bankrupt due to incompetency, massive salaries paid to incompetents, extensive irregular spending and blatant theft – “should intensify their programmes of naming and renaming” – towns that are already reeling under slum conditions and devastating neglect. Where will the money come from and how will it improve conditions and the lives of the inhabitants? As far as I know, no communities have ever been afforded the opportunity to “participate in the process of naming and renaming of public assets”, or being offered an alternative. A name is a name in whatever language. He then makes a confusing comment: “This process will continue to buttress the people’s dignity and secure security alerts requirements”. Could Paseka name one town that has suddenly flourished into a model of prosperity, excellent infrastructure and extreme cleanliness because the name of the town has been changed? The Star

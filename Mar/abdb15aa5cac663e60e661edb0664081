By Abigail Moyo In commemoration of International Women’s Day, trade union UASA, supporting the call by IndustriALL Global Union to combat the “regressive impacts of Covid-19 on women workers”, calls on trade unions to reflect on gender inequality in the workplace. UASA also supports the motion for “Women in leadership and achieving an equal future in a Covid-19 world.” We believe that gender inequality and gender-based violence are serious concerns that still affect women worldwide and need urgent intervention. UASA is deeply concerned about the high rate of gender-based violence in South Africa and across the world as more vulnerable women are still victimised in the workplace and at home, even during this time when the world is fighting a pandemic. The ILO (International Labour Organisation) reported that more women than men had lost jobs due to the Covid-19 crisis, with 5% of women losing their employment last year versus 3.9% for men. UASA calls on organisations to closely observe gender inequality in the workplace as we all know that women are under-represented in most sectors. UASA also supports the motion for “Women in leadership and achieving an equal future in a Covid-19 world”. Trade Union Uasa

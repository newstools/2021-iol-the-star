By Mandla Linda It is with a profound sadness that the Institution of Traditional Leadership learnt of the untimely passing of His Majesty, King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu, King of the Zulu Nation. The Zulu Nation, South Africa and the world will be poor without the indelible contribution of iSilo Samabandla in daily lives. We salute the king, whose lifelong mission was to serve the people by uplifting the downtrodden and the historical marginalised. The Institution of Traditional Leadership holds His Majesty in high esteem as the monarch of AmaZulu and servant of the people. The King contributed immensely in championing community development and restoration of cultural activities. In the history of the Zulu nation, His Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini is the longest reigning King, His Majesty ruled for 50 years. The king’s voice will be sorely missed as the Institution of Traditional Leadership has embarked on a new programme called InvestRural which seeks to empower rural communities. The programme’s foundation is African traditions, culture and land which the king protected and promoted at all times. The king’s wisdom would have propelled the institution to move with speed in changing the lives of the rural communities. On behalf of all traditional leaders in South Africa, the Institution of Traditional Leadership joins South Africans and the world in conveying heartfelt condolences to the Royal House and the Zulu nation that the king served with dedication to the very end. Condolences are also conveyed to the King’s Royal Council; the Usuthu Traditional Council; the KwaZulu-Natal House of Traditional Leaders; the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Government and the Republic of South Africa. The Institution of Traditional Leadership will miss the king’s wisdom and leadership. May the Soul of His Majesty the King rest in peace.

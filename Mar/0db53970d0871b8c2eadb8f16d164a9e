DURBAN - THE will of the late King Goodwill Zwelithini of the Zulu nation will be read out , in private, after his memorial service on Thursday in Nongoma. This was announced by Inkosi Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the traditional prime minister of the king during a press conference outside KwaKhethomthandayo palace on Tuesday. However, Buthelezi said he was unable to tell whether the will would name the late king's successor or who will act on the throne until a successor is identified. “It would be grossly irresponsible for me to give a preview of what will happen, especially about a sensitive matter like that. I don’t know what is in the will so I cannot speculate. The people who have the will said they wanted space so I am as ignorant as you are,” Buthelezi said. The memorial service would be held at the same palace where the mourning is taking place and it would be addressed by President Cyril Ramaphosa in the presence of his Cabinet and senior government officials. Buthelezi also clarified that there is no confusion about when the king would be interred as the royal family agreed that that would happen on Wednesday night. He said the confusion arose because the service would start towards midnight of Wednesday and proceed to the early hours of Thursday. The confusion started on Sunday when a press conference addressed by Prince Mbonisi and Princess Thembi said the burial would take place on Thursday. Minutes later, and on the same day, a statement from Buthelezi said the burial would be on Thursday.

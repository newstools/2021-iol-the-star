Johannesburg - International Women’s Day saw women in leadership positions at the 5th Annual Gender Equality, Wellness and Leadership Summit make a serious call to men, policymakers and business leaders to close the gender gap. The Motsepe Foundation hosted the 5th Annual Gender Equality, Wellness and Leadership Summit at Sandton Convention Centre on Monday where there were panel discussions on holistic health, women in charge and youth perspectives. Theme of the summit was “Harnessing the role of women in the pandemic recovery”. The summit hosted guests who included the First Lady of Rwanda Jeannette Kagame; the Minister for Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities Maite Nkoana-Mashabane; Minister of International Relations and Co-operation Dr Naledi Pandor; Associate scientific director of the Centre for the Aids Programme of Research in South Africa Quarraisha Abdool Karim; co-chairperson of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Covid-19 Professor Salim Abdool Karim; and Miss South Africa 2020 Shudufhadzo Musida. Motsepe Foundation co-founder Precious Moloi-Motsepe called on policymakers, government and business leaders to act now to close the gender gap between men and women. “We call upon leaders, men and women who care about human rights and economic growth and development of our countries: work harder in harnessing women’s leadership to ensure that women can become active participants in the post-Covid-19 economic recovery and beyond,” she said. Moloi-Motsepe added that gender equality was not only a women’s issue and that it was a moral imperative that made moral and economic sense. Keynote speaker Kagame said since 2003 Rwanda had had the highest female representation in parliament in the world and that the country’s views on women had changed in the past generation as more women joined government ranks: “Today seeing women in parliament gives women and girls confidence and pride.” The Star

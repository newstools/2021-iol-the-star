Last week during his State of the Nation Address, President Cyril Ramaphosa said the first phase of the vaccination programme, which is targeted at health and other frontline workers, will now use the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which has been shown to be effective against the 501Y.V2 variant. "We have secured 9 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The first batch, of 80,000 doses, will arrive in the country this week. Further consignments will arrive over the next four weeks, totalling 500,000 Johnson & Johnson vaccines. All provinces have roll-out plans in place as the first vaccines come through," he said. Ramaphosa said 12 million vaccine doses from the global Covax facility had also been secured.  Pfizer has committed 20m vaccine doses commencing with deliveries at the end of the first quarter. "We are continuing our engagements with all the vaccine manufacturers to ensure that we secure sufficient quantities of vaccines that are suitable to our conditions," Ramaphosa said. IOL

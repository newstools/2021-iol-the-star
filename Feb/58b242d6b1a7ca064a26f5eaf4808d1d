Johannesburg - South African Weather Services (Saws) has warned of more possible disruptive rainfall across Gauteng throughout the week. According to SAWS weather forecaster Luthando Masimini, they anticipate an 80% chance of showers and rain for the rest of the week. “We expect there to be rain throughout the week across Gauteng. We have given a yellow warning for level two – which is for disruptive rain – which might result in localised flooding in informal settlements and roads,” said Masimini. The heavy rain is expected to affect low-lying areas and bridges. Masimini also added that there would be difficult driving conditions as well as road closures. “Motorists must be aware of low-lying bridges that may be affected by floods, particularly in Gauteng’s southern areas,” said Masimini. In a statement issued on Monday, the Saws gave a yellow level 4 warning for disruptive rain over Gauteng, the western Bushveld of Limpopo, western Mpumalanga, the central and eastern parts of North West province and the north-eastern Free State. The Saws urged residents to avoid low-lying bridges and to maintain safe following distances as the downpours have already left some bridges and roads submerged under water. As the rainy weather persisted, Johannesburg Emergency Management Services spokesperson Nana Radebe said: “There has been no major damage to infrastructure and there have been no reports of floods in Gauteng.” The Star

Pretoria - A 24-year-old Limpopo man who was arrested in connection with the murder of 13-year-old Lerato Ramatsela was denied bail when he appeared before the Tiyani Magistrate’s Court. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said in a statement that Moses Manganye appeared in court on Tuesday for the killing of the teenager on February 10 at Thabanaswana village outside Giyani. “He was denied bail and the case was postponed to Thursday ... for further police investigations,” said Ngoepe. Neighbours reportedly discovered Ramatsela’s body in the bushes with her hands tied. They immediately summoned police who launched a manhunt for the suspect. The teenager is believed to have been strangled. “The suspect who is staying in the area was immediately arrested at his home. Police investigations are still underway,” said Ngoepe. Last week, a 39-year-old Limpopo man was sentenced to life in jail for raping a 75-year-old woman who had given him overnight accommodation. Solly Ntlwane of Mecklenburg was sentenced in the Burgersfort regional court for the April 2019 attack after the old woman let him stay over because she knew his father. According to the National Prosecuting Authority, during that night Ntlwane left the bedroom he was sleeping in and went to the woman’s bedroom where he raped her five times. After the ordeal, Ntlwane told her he would bring her milk and bread the following day. In the morning the victim told her neighbours about the rape, which was confirmed after a medical examination. Ntlwane later returned to the woman’s house to bring the promised food and was arrested by neighbours who were waiting for him there. During the trial, Ntlwane pleaded not guilty to the charge, claiming the old woman had invited him to her house, but she denied this, telling the court that before the rape, she had last had sexual intercourse 30-years ago. The court rejected Ntlwane’s version of events and convicted him of rape. The Star

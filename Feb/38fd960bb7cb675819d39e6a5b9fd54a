Johannesburg - Joburg Economic Development MMC Lawrence Khoza recently embarked on a mission to assist businesses to stabilise the city’s economy in Kya Sands, Lanseria City Airport and Joburg Market. As part of the city’s reconstruction and recovery of the economy, Khoza met with various business owners in order to understand the challenges they faced as a result of Covid-19. Khoza said businesses he visited were durable and that he was excited to learn that there is a commitment to a partnership between the public sector and the private sector. Khoza listed crime, power and re-skilling of labour forces as challenges faced by the businesses in the city. On February 17, Khoza met with the leadership of the Joburg Market, where he was taken through challenges and the interventions required to grow the market. The Joburg Market plays a critical role in the fresh produce industry to over 6000 producers and access to over 98000 registered buyers across South Africa and the SADC region. Market agents and tenants operating within its facilities create over 5 000 jobs within the sector. On February 22, Khoza visited Wasaa Gasses and the management of Lanseria City Airport to get an understanding of the challenges they face amid slow economic growth. Part of his visit was to establish how the city can partner with them as part of its reconstruction and the recovery of the economy initiative. “The main reason for the visit to Wasaa Gasses was to showcase the potential of Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) in addressing some of the energy issues the country is plagued with, and to also highlighting the opportunities that exist in the value chain.” Khoza described Lanseria Airport as a key anchoring economic node in the proposed Lanseria Smart City, and also a strategic partner of the city. Khoza said municipalities have a role to play when it came to their policy choices and directed investments. The Star

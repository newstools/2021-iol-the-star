Johannesburg - A  young matric student from St Mary’s Waverley School for Girls has made it her mission to succeed through the uncertainty of the pandemic. Tlou Duba, head girl at St Mary's Waverley, scooped seven distinctions in her final exams. The bright learner with accolades and badges has been a top achiever her whole life and plans to study computer science at UCT. “I have always found coding interesting and it’s always been something I would like to pursue,” said Duba. She said having to write her matric during the pandemic was stressful, particularly with the uncertainty that came with the virus. “But once we got the hang of it, it was better. Admittedly, adjusting to online learning was very challenging. However, I was very determined to work harder and put in the effort,” she said. Duba has been recognised for her work ethic, even among her peers. She received her academic Blazer at the end of 2019 for acquiring all the academic points she needed and being consistent. “I tried my level best and worked hard. My family were very supportive throughout my final exams and matric year. I’m thankful to them and my teachers, athough it’s unfortunate that we were not able to carry out the plans we had for the matric year,” said Duba. Her advice to the class of 2021 is for them to find a balance between school and social activities. “People think it’s all about academics, but you need to find your balance in life. Don't deprive yourself of sleep. Make sure you are still able to fit things that you like to do, such as sports, in your schedule,” said Duba. She obtained distinctions in advanced programme maths as well as in English, Information Technology, Life Orientation, Life Sciences, Maths, Physical Sciences and Sesotho. The Star

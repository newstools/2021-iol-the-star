Cape Town - The Cabinet has appointed new bosses for the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) and the South African Post Office (Sapo) after the two positions had been vacant for a while. Acting Minister in the Presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni said on Friday Zolani Kgotsietsile Matthews will be the new Prasa CEO and Nomkhitha Mona has been appointed South African Post Office (Sapo) CEO. Sapo has been without a permanent CEO since Mark Barnes left a few years ago. Prasa has been mired in controversy with damning evidence led at the Zondo commission, where allegations of corruption have swirled in the past few months. This week, new allegations on its trains was also heard in the commission. A few months ago Cabinet appointed a new board at Prasa chaired by former ANC MP Leonard Ramatlakane. Sapo has in the past few years received bailouts from the government. The post office has also blamed the decline in mail volumes. It had been forced to close down some of its branches because of poor performance. siyabonga.mkhwanazi@inl.co.za Political Bureau

Johannesburg - When Lesego Tlhabi, popularly known as social media sensation Coconut Kelz, appeared on the show Trending SA, she jokingly said she would come back to the show as a presenter. Now, just short of a month later, her words have come to fruition. “I literally manifested this moment. I spoke about being a Trending presenter specifically. Even on air I ‘joked’ about it being my audition, so to say I’m super excited is honestly an understatement. It finally feels like everything I’ve worked for I’m starting to reap the rewards for and I couldn’t be more grateful and eager for the road ahead,” said Tlhabi. From today Trending SA is back for a 6th season with Tlhabi and two other new faces added to the show in Luthando “Lootlove” Shosha and Moeti “Mo Flava” Tsiki. “I am so excited to bring this new season of Trending SA to our audiences. We have kept the premise and the heart of the show,” said series producer Sive Nkukwana. “We are still the leaders in social commentary and we love being at the centre of what South Africa is talking about,” Nkukwana said. Former presenters Elma Smit and Refiloe Mpakanyane leave the magazine show, while MaBlerh stays on as the main host of the show. Tlhabi, Tsiki and Shosha will alternate as co-hosts. “I am extremely excited about this opportunity. Trending SA is a show I enjoy and I am a fan of talk TV, so joining the team is amazing,” said Tsiki, who also hosts the morning drive show on MetroFM. The social media magazine show has added a more engaging aspect for audiences, focusing on features and more interviews with thought-leaders, celebrities and ‘super-sized round-table conversations’. Trending SA airs on SABC3 on weekdays at 6pm. The Star

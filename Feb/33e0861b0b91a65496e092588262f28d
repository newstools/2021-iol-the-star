By Marcus Monyakeni During the past week, the country has experienced major rainfall emanating from the effect of tropical cyclone Eloise, which has caused damage and floods in some parts of the country, leaving a trail of destruction due to flash floods. The public are warned not to participate in any activities in isolated dams and heavy flowing rivers, as that might endanger their lives. The Department of Water and Sanitation note, with mixed reactions, the current rainfall that has continued to fall in most parts of the country. On a positive note, it has been filling both rivers and dams to a desired capacity but unfortunately, at the same time, it has caused floods across the country. Communities living close to rivers and dams are advised to be alert to changing weather patterns and, should the need arise, they are advised to seek shelter in high-lying areas for safety. Building unnecessary walls also contributes to flooding and pooling in neighbour’s yards. It is advisable to divert water run-off in a direction where it will not pool or cause flooding in the yards. Municipalities also play a vital role in keeping storm drainage systems functional, as the drainage system is designed to remove stormwater from areas such as streets and pavements for the public’s safety. Therefore the department calls on municipalities to heed the call to maintain water drainage systems on regular basis. Marcus Monyakeni is from the Department of Water and Sanitation. The Star

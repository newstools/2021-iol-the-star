By Mapo Phaahle wa Mokoena In this month, the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) commemorates the lives of two formidable liberation Struggle heroes who fought gallantly for the liberation of mankind and the indigenous dispossessed Afrikan majority. As usual, the mainstream media remained silent. Here I’m talking about Professor Mangaliso Sobukwe and Commander Victor Qwetha nom de guerre Sabelo Phama. Our mainstream media houses are captured by capitalist imperial moguls who are hellbent on distorting the history of the PAC and also making it their project to edit the PAC out of liberation history books. One thing these media powerhouses forget, is that we as Afrikanists will never relent in telling our story. It is our inborn duty and responsibility to defend the legacy of the PAC and its past glorious leaders. The month of February is Sobukwe Month on the national calendar of the PAC but the so-called independent and impartial public broadcaster, the SABC, won’t dedicate even 30 minutes to enlighten the African masses about the prowess of Prof Sobukwe and Commander Sabelo Phama. If this was their darling Nelson Mandela we would be bombarded by his commemoration on all TV and radio stations. I will no longer pay my TV licence as a protest to unfair coverage when it comes to political parties.On February 28, the PAC of Azania will be hosting the commemoration of Prof Sobukwe in Soweto and the programme will start at the Methodist Church which he attended. We will proceed to his house in Mofolo where he stayed then complete the programme at the Joburg regional office of the PAC. Members of the public are welcome because there will be speeches dedicated to the professor. The Star

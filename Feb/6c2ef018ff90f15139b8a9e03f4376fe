Johannesburg - Singer and songwriter Shekhinah is in the business of creativity. The 26-year-old self-made star has released a thought-provoking short film for her single Fixate, off her upcoming album. She said the short film was an artistic piece of work that told an important story and explored themes such as rebirth and resilience. “When all your selves speak at once, how do you know who is telling the truth? are the first words the singer narrates, giving the audience an opening to gather their own thoughts,” she said. “I’ve been so many different people, some angry, some free … I love them all because I have to. I sing them to sleep when they visit at night.” The film sees Shekhinah documenting her journey through the lyrics of the song, putting the words together to create what is now a radio hit. “I’ve marched down streets that wanted to swallow me whole. I’ve set fires and then run away.” She takes the viewers through a journey to self-love and actualisation using symbolism and heartfelt lyrics to get the message across. The creative wrote, performed in and narrated the video. “My new project Trouble in Paradise is a continuation of my first album RoseGold which spoke to blissful ignorance. The idea is that all that was RoseGold is now ablaze. Paradise is no longer the place it used to be and trouble has come. Red for me signifies the burning of paradise," she said. The Durban-born singer released the short film on Valentine’s Day. The actual single features Kenyan artist Bey T, a 21-year-old Nairobi-born singer who is making her own moves in East Africa. The short film was directed by Monde Gumede and styled by Boogie Maboi. “There’s a light that shines through … I’ve seen it once and I’ll see it again,” Shekhinah concludes as the video moves into a different song, Insecure, which is one of the offerings on her upcoming sophomore album.

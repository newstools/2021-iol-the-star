By Tebogo Brown I have come to realise that life-changing events are taking place all over the world while a majority of us are still enjoying a nap. Part of what is happening is a rapid construction of smart cities. The construction takes place right in the middle of what they call a life-threatening “pandemic”. In his State of the Nation address President Cyril Ramaphosa said: “Two years ago I spoke about the dream of building new cities that will enable us to make a break with apartheid’s spatial development … the Lanseria Smart City, the first new city to be built in a democratic South Africa, is now a reality in the making. “The draft master plan for this smart city – which will become home to between 350 000 to 500 000 people within the next decade – was completed in November and is now out for public comment.” First, this is not the dream of Ramaphosa and it has nothing to do with breaking apartheid’s spatial. Almost every head of state shares the same “dream” as Ramaphosa, but in reality, this is the dream of the technocrats, men and women who are in charge. This is part of the “great reset”. All over the world, smart cities are springing up like mushrooms and the 5G technology is exactly what the doctor ordered to advance the project. The Star

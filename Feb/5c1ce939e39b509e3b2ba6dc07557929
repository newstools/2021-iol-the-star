Johannesburg - Limpopo police have intensified the hunt for a 63-year-old man who allegedly shot his 55-year-old wife multiple times, instantly killing her. Spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the incident happened on Saturday night in Mbhalati,  Malamulele just outside Giyani in the Vhembe District. “A quarrel reportedly ensued between the suspect and his second wife at about 7.30pm. The suspect then produced his licensed firearm and shot her several times,” said Ngoepe. Limpopo provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba has directed that the suspect be “hunted down until he is brought to book”. Community members with information that can lead to his arrest are encouraged to report to the nearest police station or use the MySAPS app. Last year the husband of one of the two women killed in Limpopo was among five people arrested for the double murder. The 56-year-old husband was nabbed in October in a hospital after allegedly trying to commit suicide. Property businesswoman Tebogo Mphuti, 35, and her friend Makoena Mabusela-Leshabane, 46, a senior aviation finance consultant at Investec, were shot and killed in a suspected hit while they were about to view a warehouse to rent in Magnavia, Polokwane.

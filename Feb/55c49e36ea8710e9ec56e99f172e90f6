By Gavin Kelly We, the Road Freight Association (RFA), are concerned about the recent suspension of the Road Traffic Infringement Agency’s chief executive officer, Japh Chuwe, amidst allegations of “serious maladministration” by the auditor-general. This has a severe impact on the implementation of the highly controversial Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences Act (Aarto), which is scheduled to be implemented in July this year. Once Aarto is implemented, the RTIA will be handling billions of rands. How can we now trust the entity – especially when the dishonesty and corruption is allegedly at the highest level in the agency? We already face huge corruption, extortion and intimidation at the hands of traffic police on a daily basis, and this latest development has highlighted how rampant dishonesty is in the public service – especially in the traffic law enforcement and management structures. These allegations have undermined what little faith we had in RTIA. We envisage theft on a grand scale. The RFA again proposes Aarto be shelved. The continuously amended system is about generating revenue and not road safety, which was what the system was originally about.

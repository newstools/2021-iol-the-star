By Visvin Reddy Social media was abuzz with some South Africans of Indian origin lambasting President Cyril Ramaphosa for not thanking the Indian government for “graciously” donating a million vaccine doses to the people of South Africa. Those who took to Facebook and Twitter, spewing this nonsense, were all ill-informed and did not have the facts. The Indian community in South Africa is easily swayed by fake news designed to whip up their emotions, especially against the ANC government. This is no public relations exercise for the Presidency, or the ANC for that matter, but it infuriates me when irresponsible people are quick to make up stories. The facts relating to the vaccine procured by South Africa are as follows: The patent holder and owner of the vaccine that came from India is AstraZeneca, a British-Swedish pharmaceutical company with its headquarters in England. AstraZeneca partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture the vaccines. South Africa bought a million doses from AstraZeneca, at around R78.30 each, when countries like Italy , Germany and France paid about R30. The Serum Institute of India is a privately-owned drug manufacturing plant that identified South Africa as an upper-middle-income country. We see that the vaccines were not given for free to South Africa; they were a pure business transaction. Any suggestion otherwise is a blatant lie. Why has the Indian government not responded to the nonsense? The answer is simple – it had nothing to do with the deal. The Star

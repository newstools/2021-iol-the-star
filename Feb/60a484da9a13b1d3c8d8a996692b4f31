The taxi careered down an embankment about 30km outside of Wolmaransstad, North West, on Sunday night. The cause of the accident is not yet known. ER24’s Russel Meiring said they arrived at the scene along with other services to find the taxi on the side of the road. “Several people were found scattered on the side of the road. “Paramedics assessed the patients and found that eight people, including a boy, believed to be 3 years old, had sustained fatal injuries.

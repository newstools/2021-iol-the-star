South Africa has some of the highest gender-based violence (GBV) statistics in the world, with a staggering 40% of women in the country reported to have been sexually or physically abused in their lifetime. More shocking than these statistics is the fact that 50% of women in the country have reported emotional and economic abuse at the hands of their partners. With such high numbers of abuse, the odds seem to be stacked against SA’s men as a nation of abusers. There are a great deal of South African men who actively seek ways to provide safer living environments for all women in the country. The #CutTheStereotype campaign aims to enable men in society to serve as antiGBV activists. The campaign, which was launched on Friday, will run through the month, spreading a different kind of love, with all 30 Legends Barbershops offering free True Legends cuts. The cut is a unique slashed teardrop shaved into the hair or beard, as a crest showing people that true legends protect women and stand against GBV. Mara Glennie, founder and director of the Tears Foundation, said: “This partnership with South Africa’s iconic Legends Barbershop will not only fuel our drive in fighting the horrific acts of GBV, but will also amplify women’s voices, as well as getting support from the good men in society, who continue to serve as our protectors.” Sheldon Tatchell, founder of Legends Barbershop, said: “We are proud of our partnership with the Tears Foundation on this campaign to mobilise men and help foster safe communities for our women. A great opportunity for us as a country to unify our efforts in fighting GBV, alongside a foundation that has been truly instrumental in helping sexual abuse victims.” The Star

By Editorial On Monday, ANC NEC member Senzo Mchunu was embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal dating back to 2019. The incident was detailed in a letter written by the victim to the ANC as well as the Women’s League general secretary, where an employee at Luthuli House told how Mchunu allegedly made sexual advances that she rejected – after which she lost her job as an employee under him, as political head of organising at the time. Responding to the allegations, Mchunu through his spokesperson said that the matter was closed after a formal investigation and that its findings had been communicated to the victim and the minister. The ANC Women’s League has failed to respond to questions on the allegation as well as whether there have been any reports of a similar nature that it has received against any other Cabinet ministers in the past three years. Both the EFF and DA have called for the allegations to be scrutinised, with DA questioning whether Cyril Ramaphosa knew of these allegations before appointing him as minister. The party said it would be submitting a series of written parliamentary questions to the president asking this. The EFF said the minister through his alleged actions did not have the moral responsibility and societal value to hold office. It is important to protect the victims of abuse in the workplace, especially at the hands of powerful politicians. Whatever investigations were conducted internally by the ANC, to claim the matter has been put to rest when the victim is clearly aggrieved by the one-sided processes is clearly a cop out. Powerful politicians must learn that they are not above the law and that they do not own individuals or defenceless women in the workplace. Also, women do not owe men sexual favours for getting them jobs in the workplace. Men who engage in this kind of practice need to be held accountable for their predatory actions. The Star

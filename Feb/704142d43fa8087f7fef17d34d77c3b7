The case against Isibaya actress Zinhle Mabena, for allegedly conspiring to murder her estranged husband, Mugabe Ngwenya, has been dismissed. She was arrested on Tuesday and appeared in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday, where the case against her was dropped due to lack of evidence. In a media statement, her attorney, Joshua Larazus of Shapiro&Ledwaba Incorporated, said her arrest was unlawful. “I act on behalf of Zinhle and confirm that she was unlawfully taken into custody … but is now a free woman after the NPA (National Prosecuting Authority) declined to place the matter on the roll, because of the preposterous nature of the allegations against our client,” Lazarus said. “We also confirm that nothing plausible was provided to the authorities to link our client to any crime including but not limited to murder to attempted murder or any conspiracy. “All these mischievous allegations allegedly ironically come from her husband, who she has recently filed for divorce (from), and against whom our client has obtained (an) interim protection order.” Meanwhile, Ngwenya is set to release a tell-all memoir about his life’s journey, including his failed marriage to Mabena. Taking to Instagram recently, he revealed: “The book will be titled, 5 Years in Marriage: A Chronicle of Love, Marriage and Divorce, by Dr Robert Ngwenya. It's a journey starting from excited butterfly feelings in the stomach and slowly progressing into ugly fights and inevitable separation. It’s a personal analysis of marriage-based experience and lessons that life has so carefully and slowly taught.” The Star

Johannesburg - The case of  a 35-year-old man accused of raping and killing a young Soweto woman in December has been postponed. Themba Mothogoane, 35, appeared at the Protea Magistrate’s court on Wednesday on charges of rape, murder and defeating the ends of justice. Mothogoane is accused of brutally murdering Unisa student Phuthi Ramara, 21. Mothogoane was allegedly with Phuthi when her friends last saw her, before her naked body was discovered by a jogger in the early hours of the morning in an open playground in Protea Glen extension 31. She had been beaten, raped and strangled with her own pants. Mothogoane was arrested after being on the run since the discovery of Phuthi’s body. According to police, Mothogoane was arrested on December 28 after a tip-off that led them to Ivory Park taxi rank. Police said he was on his way to Johannesburg from Tembisa, intending to cross the border to Lesotho. The case was postponed to next week for the accused to apply for legal representation before applying for bail. Mother of the deceased Sibongile Ramara said her wish was to see all those involved in the death of her daughter behind bars. “It breaks my heart seeing them daily, as they seem fine, while my child, who they fetched at home, is no more,” she said. She urged the magistrate to deny Mathogoane bail. Gauteng Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko has since launched the Gender-Based Violence Brigades in Soweto as part of the province’s response to violence against women and children. The Star

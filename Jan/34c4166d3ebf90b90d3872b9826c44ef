Linden Burns Although South Africa’s land borders are closed until at least mid-February as stated by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday night, Airlink, the independent airline, will continue to serve southern Africa’s main commercial centres with a flight schedule and air route network. South Africa’s decision to close its 20 land borders for all but emergency and exceptional travel comes as countries across the region continue with efforts to curb Covid-19 infections and limit the pandemic’s harmful social and economic impact. “Health and safety are critical, as is economic continuity, for which regional air travel is the only viable alternative. “Airlink will continue to provide travellers with safe, reliable and affordable connectivity between South Africa and destinations throughout southern Africa,” said Airlink managing director and chief executive, Rodger Foster. Airlink serves Lubumbashi (DRC), Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), Maseru (Lesotho), Sikhuphe (Eswatini), Harare and Bulawayo (Zimbabwe), Gaborone, Maun and Kasane (Botswana), Windhoek and Walvis Bay (Namibia), Lusaka and Ndola (Zambia), Maputo, Beira, Pemba and Vilanculos (Mozambique) as well as numerous South African destinations. Airlink flights are scheduled to enable customers and personnel to comply with South Africa’s curfew and still commute to and from airports with sufficient time to complete the necessary health, security and immigration checks before departure. Flights depart after 8am in line with curfew regulations. Similarly, flights arrive at their final destinations before 8pm, providing customers and personnel with sufficient time to reach their homes or places of accommodation before curfew. The Star

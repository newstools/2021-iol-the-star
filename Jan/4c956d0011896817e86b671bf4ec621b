Johannesburg - After the success of the KwaZulu-Natal Entertainment Awards, comes the Platinum Music Awards (Plamas) for the North West. The first Plamas are scheduled to take place in the first quarter of the year. Aimed at celebrating excellence in music, the awards will acknowledge artists, musicians and producers who were born, raised or are residents of the North West. Last month, the organisers, KST Multimedia, made a call for entries to be submitted. The entries will be considered by a panel of music, art and culture experts who will vet and shortlist the finalists. The winners will be decided by public vote. Some 19 categories including Best Dance Album, Best African Pop Album, Best Traditional Album, Best Afrikaans Album, Best Traditional Faith Album, Best Jazz Album, Best R&B/Soul/Reggae Album and Best Rap Album are open for competition. In addition to Song of the Year, Best Album, Best Female Artist, Best Male Artist, Best Newcomer and Best Duo/ Group will be awarded. Plamas spokesperson Sanele Makinane of KST Multimedia said they had assembled a team of individuals to ensure they deliver a world-class experience the North West people would be proud of. “We make the call to have our musicians enter their music and stand a chance to be nominated for these prestigious awards. More information will be released in due course.” The Star

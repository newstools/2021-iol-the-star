Johannesburg - A Potchefstroom, North West man who went sailing with a friend did not come out of the dam alive after drowning when his yacht capsized. Captain Sam Tselanyane of the North West Police said information at their disposal was that George Dannhauser and his 59-year old friend went to the Boskop Dam with their yachts around 8am on Wednesday. However, the friend decided to return back to the shore while Dannhauser sailed further. “At about 8.25am, workers at one of the lodges near the dam saw the yacht that capsized in the water and called for help. “The Police Divers were summoned and later joined by the Airwing and members of the community with a private chopper as well as drones. The search for the man was conducted, but called off temporarily at 23:30 for continuation on Thursday. “The search by SAPS Divers and K9 tracker dog as well as Potchefstroom Fire Brigade  resumed at 9am, leading to retrieving of the lifeless body of Dannhauser at about 12.15,  approximately 30m from where the capsized yacht was seen on Wednesday.” Tselenyane said an inquest case has been opened and investigations into Dannhauser’s death continue.

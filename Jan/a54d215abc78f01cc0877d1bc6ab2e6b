Johannesburg -  Gauteng MEC for Human Settlements, Urban Planning and Cogta, Lebogang Maile announced on Sunday the untimely death of Sedibeng District Municipality mayor Busisiwe Modisakeng, who passed away after a short illness at the age of 60. Modisakeng assumed the position of mayor after the watershed 2016 local government elections. “On behalf of the Gauteng provincial government led by Premier David Makhura, we extend our heartfelt condolences to the Modisakeng family, her colleagues in exco and the African National Congress”, said Maile. Modisakeng was among the longest-serving public representatives in local government. She occupied various leadership positions, first as mayor of Lesedi Local Municipality for three successive terms, speaker of Sedibeng District Municipality, and most recently, mayor of Sedibeng District Municipality. She cut her political teeth in the student movement, specifically in the Congress of SA Students during the height of apartheid, and grew within the ranks of the Mass Democratic Movement, occupying key positions of responsibility in progressive organisations: Congress of South African Trade Unions, SA Communist Party and civic bodies. Modisakeng passed away at a time when the Gauteng government is working hard to strengthen cooperative governance in order to expedite service delivery in communities. “Her sudden demise robs the people of Gauteng and Sedibeng in particular of a committed servant of the people who did her utmost in pursuit of service delivery improvement,” said Maile who is expected to visit the Modisakeng family to extend the government’s condolences. Details of the memorial and funeral services will be shared once discussions have been finalised with the family. The Star

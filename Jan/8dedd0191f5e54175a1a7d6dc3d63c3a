I would like to express my deepest condolences to the Netcare hospital group, families, friends and loved ones of the health-care workers who died in a Netcare 911 air ambulance helicopter crash. When a tragic incident happens, it touches and affects us all. This tragedy, during a time of enormous anxiety due to the Covid-19 virus, makes each one of us re-examine our strategies, desires, priorities and to think more carefully about what is essential in our lives. Perhaps, from this tragedy and the current virus, come a greater understanding of family, community, friends and religious bonds? As the coronavirus pandemic rips across jobs and homes, and places broad limitations on our lives, Covid19 is fuelling important life skills lessons, often accompanied by strong feelings and complex issues for many of us. As a result of the uncertainty of the pandemic, we are experiencing stress, loss or grief at unprecedented and varying levels. The pandemic has brought home bitter realities and undeniable truths. Together with safety precautions, we need to reach out to make social relationships with people; we must remember that Covid-19, not humans, affected with the virus, is the enemy. Nevertheless, “Grief is like the ocean; it comes in waves ebbing and flowing. Sometimes the water is calm; sometimes overwhelming. All we can do is learn to swim” to quote Vicki Harrison.

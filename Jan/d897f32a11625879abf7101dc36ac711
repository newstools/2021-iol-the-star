Johannesburg - Gauteng private, public or independent schools that are operating are defying the government, says Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi. This comes as the MEC said that new education protocols to delay school reopening by two weeks should be gazetted. On Friday, Deputy Minister of Basic Education Reginah Mhaule announced that the calendar for schools had been revised. School management teams would report for duty on January 25, teachers on February 1 and pupils on February 15. The reopening of schools was delayed by two weeks to monitor the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic. Private schools, which had started their 2021 academic year, were requested to shut down, too. On Monday esufi visited Helpmekaar College, a private Afrikaans school in Braamfontein, after a newsletter was sent to parents informing them that pupils must report to school on Monday. Lesufi said that when he arrived, the principal explained that they had reopened for school management last week. “When the information was brought to them about the reopening changes, they then reconsidered and they felt that they should migrate to online learning.” Lesufi said there were seven hostel pupils who would remain at the institution to access the infrastructure for online learning. He said there were other schools that were also in defiance of the directive, including the country’s largest private education provider, Curro. “I had a long discussion with the group chief executive of Curro and after our discussions. we agreed that they also have to reconsider their decision,” Lesufi said. Curro Holding spokesperson Marí Lategan announced said that learning across all Curro schools would move to online for Grade 1 and Grade 12 pupils. Lesufi said a Lanseria school had issued a communique to parents about reopening. However, the statement was retracted on Monday. The Star

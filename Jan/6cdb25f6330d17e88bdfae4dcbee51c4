By Thabile Mange I support the alcohol ban. In December 2019, the coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China. The virus then spread to other countries such as Italy and the US. It didnâ€™t just spread to other areas, it also claimed lives. Last year February, a case of Covid19 was reported in SA. The victim came from a trip in Italy. Then the virus spread across the country. The government was forced to take action to stop the spread and save lives. The government implemented level 5 to arrest the spread of Covid19. During that period, cigarette selling was banned. Tobacco companies then took government to court, but lost. In December 2020, SA entered the second wave of Covid-19. Now the virus has a new strain, which is lethal. During the same month, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced level 3 to manage the spread of the virus. After announcing level 3, the relevant minister banned alcohol. This time around cigarettes were not banned. On January 1, Chris Hani hospital, known as Baragwanath hospital, had zero patients in the casualty. This was for the very first time. Thanks to the alcohol ban. Now the South African Breweries has taken the government to court over the ban of alcohol. The SAB claims the ban is unconstitutional and it also risks the jobs of its employees, which is true. There are celebrities or so-called influencers who have joined the campaign against the alcohol ban. The actor and TV personality, Khanyi Mbau, is one of them. There is also a theory that these individuals have been paid to be part of this campaign. The truth of the matter is that alcohol is a problem in this country. It contributes to many social ills such as women abuse, crime and deaths on the road. It has taken the coronavirus to expose this known fact. Personally, I support the ban of alcohol. Since the banning of booze, many lives have been saved from contracting the virus, abuse and dying on the roads. So, the government has my blessings. The Star

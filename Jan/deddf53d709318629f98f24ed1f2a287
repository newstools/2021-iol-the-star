Two days ago the nation listened to the State Security Agency Acting Director-General Loyiso Jafta airing state secrets at the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. The testimony was meant to give light and guidance in finding out any wrongdoing and the perpetrators in the employ of state entities. What stood out though was Jafta’s testimony against the wishes of his boss, Minister Ayanda Dlodlo, whose attempt to block the proceedings was unsuccessful. This was an indication that relations between the two (Dlodlo and Jafta) are irreparable. Of concern was the latter’s testimony on the government’s slush funds and foreign political involvement. One of Dlodlo’s concerns about Jafta’s move to testify was that his testimony would expose and compromise the country’s national security. It is indeed unheard of for a country to air its state secrets in public. However, the argument in this case is that there is an endeavour to bring forth the truths about those who are abusing, stealing and misusing state resources. The scary part in all the unfolding drama at the commission is that it would seem that within the government there are two sides who are fighting their battles using the commission as a stage. Having said all the above, it must be noted that it seldom happens that a country compromises itself by disclosing state secrets to the public. This raises the question as to whether there were no other means of identifying abusers of state resources or thieves in the agency. One view in the article published by the Daily News on Wednesday was that by being apologetic about its SSA, the country would pay a heavy price by being undermined by other countries in the SADC.
